## Selected Projects

### A. VR Training & Assessment System for Vehicle Inspection of Motor Vehicles (Core Member · Vice Captain)

**Overview**  
	A Unity-based VR platform that simulates real vehicle inspection workflows (covering core inspection stations: toe adjustment (wheel alignment), headlamp beam aiming test (using a beam setter), and hub dynamometer / roller bench test (wheel-rotation-based testing)).  
	Supports practice / mock exam / formal assessment with operation logging and scoring analysis, reducing equipment occupancy and training cost.

**My Contributions**

- Designed and implemented interactive workflows and scoring logic for **toe adjustment** and **headlight inspection** modules
- Built the **operation record & score evaluation** subsystem (rule configuration, statistics, basic visualization UI)
- Assisted in scene integration and performance optimization for stable FPS on common hardware
- Collaborated with instructors and enterprise partner (FAW-Volkswagen Talent Development & Empowerment Center) for iterative delivery

**Tech**: Unity · C# · VR Simulation · Interaction Design · Assessment Logic

### B. Surface Defect Visual Inspection System for Vehicle Parts (Team Lead)

**Overview**  
An industrial surface-defect detection system based on **YOLOv8** for **rolled-in scale (RS)**, **patches (Pa)**, **cracks (Cr)**, **pitted surface (PS)**, **inclusions (In)**, and **scratches (Sc)**, covering an end-to-end pipeline from dataset construction to model training and deployment.

**My Contributions**

- Led algorithm design and training workflow: labeling specification, augmentation strategy, hyperparameter tuning
- Exported YOLOv8 model to **ONNX**, handled dependency adaptation and performance tuning
- Designed a unified inference pipeline balancing detection quality and real-time performance
- Coordinated technical alignment with **Han’s Laser Technology Industry Group** for engineering-grade deployment direction

**Tech**: YOLOv8 · Object Detection · Deep Learning · ONNX · Industrial Vision

### C. 2026 Hangzhou International Green & Low-Carbon Industry Expo Proposal (Competition Project · Vice Captain)

> Note: Competition project (simulated expo planning), not a real offline expo.

**Overview**  
A comprehensive expo planning proposal under the theme “绿韵长河共潮生，智链零碳绘杭城”, integrating national “Dual-Carbon” strategy with Hangzhou’s green industry layout.  
Explores “Green & Low-Carbon + Digital Tech + Urban Expo” as a structured solution.

**My Contributions**

- Co-built the overall proposal framework and thematic boundaries (zero-carbon tech, green city, circular economy, etc.)
- Took ownership of key chapters: initiation analysis, basic info, policy linkage, activity design, emergency strategy
- Proposed digital exhibition concepts (interactive screens, data visualization, virtual exhibition hall)
- Contributed to risk response (policy change, self-sustainability) and differentiation strategy
